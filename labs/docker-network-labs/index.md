# 1.0 Running your first container
In this section, you are going to run an Alpine Linux container (a lightweight linux distribution) on your system and get a taste of the docker run command.

To get started, let's run the following in our terminal:

```
$ docker pull alpine
```


The pull command fetches the alpine image from the Docker registry and saves it in our system. You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system.

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
alpine                  latest              c51f86c28340        4 weeks ago         1.109 MB
hello-world             latest              690ed74de00f        5 months ago        960 B
```

### 1.1 Docker Run

Great! Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that you are going to use the docker run command.

```
$ docker run alpine ls -l
total 48
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           360 Mar 18 09:47 dev
drwxr-xr-x   13 root     root          4096 Mar 18 09:47 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 home
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 lib
......
......

```

What happened? Behind the scenes, a lot of stuff happened. When you call run,

The Docker client contacts the Docker daemon

The Docker daemon checks local store if the image (alpine in this case) is available locally, and if not, downloads it from Docker Store. (Since we have issued docker pull alpine before, the download step is not necessary)

The Docker daemon creates the container and then runs a command in that container.

The Docker daemon streams the output of the command to the Docker client
When you run docker run alpine, you provided a command (ls -l), so Docker started the command specified and you saw the listing.

Let's try something more exciting.

```
$ docker run alpine echo "hello from alpine"
hello from alpine
```

OK, that's some actual output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our alpine container and then exited it. If you've noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it. Now you know why they say containers are fast!

Try another command.

```
$ docker run alpine /bin/sh

```
Wait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. These interactive shells will exit after running any scripted commands, unless they are run in an interactive terminal - so for this example to not exit, you need to 

```
docker run -it alpine /bin/sh.
```

You are now inside the container shell and you can try out a few commands like ls -l, uname -a and others. Exit out of the container by giving the exit command.

Ok, now it's time to see the docker ps command. The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
Since no containers are running, you see a blank line. Let's try a more useful variant: docker ps -a

$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
36171a5da744        alpine              "/bin/sh"                5 minutes ago       Exited (0) 2 minutes ago                        fervent_newton
a6a9d46d0b2f        alpine             "echo 'hello from alp"    6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 6 minutes ago                        lonely_kilby
ff0a5c3750b9        alpine             "ls -l"                   8 minutes ago       Exited (0) 8 minutes ago                        elated_ramanujan
c317d0a9e3d2        hello-world         "/hello"                 34 seconds ago      Exited (0) 12 minutes ago                       stupefied_mcclintock
```

What you see above is a list of all containers that you ran. Notice that the STATUS column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago. You're probably wondering if there is a way to run more than just one command in a container. Let's try that now:

```
$ docker run -it alpine /bin/sh
/ # ls
bin      dev      etc      home     lib      linuxrc  media    mnt      proc     root     run      sbin     sys      tmp      usr      var
/ # uname -a
Linux 97916e8cb5dc 4.4.27-moby #1 SMP Wed Oct 26 14:01:48 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux

```

Running the run command with the -it flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. Now you can run as many commands in the container as you want. Take some time to run your favorite commands.

That concludes a whirlwind tour of the docker run command which would most likely be the command you'll use most often. It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. To find out more about run, use docker run --help to see a list of all flags it supports. As you proceed further, we'll see a few more variants of docker run.

### 1.2 Terminology
In the last section, you saw a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before you go further, let's clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.

Images - The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers. To find out more about a Docker image, run docker inspect alpine. In the demo above, you used the docker pull command to download the alpine image. When you executed the command docker run hello-world, it also did a docker pull behind the scenes to download the hello-world image.

Containers - Running instances of Docker images â€” containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS. You created a container using docker run which you did using the alpine image that you downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.

Docker daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.

Docker client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon.

Docker Store - A registry of Docker images, where you can find trusted and enterprise ready containers, plugins, and Docker editions.



# DOCKER NETWORKING BASICS

In this lab you'll look at the most basic networking components that come with a fresh installation of Docker.

You will complete the following steps as part of this lab.

Step 1 - The docker network command

Step 2 - List networks

Step 3 - Inspect a network

Step 4 - List network driver plugins

Step 1: The docker network command

The docker network command is the main command for configuring and managing container networks.

Run a simple docker network command from any of your lab machines.

```
$ docker network


Usage:  docker network COMMAND

##Manage Docker networks

Options:
      --help   Print usage

Commands:
  connect     Connect a container to a network
  create      Create a network
  disconnect  Disconnect a container from a network
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more networks
  ls          List networks
  rm          Remove one or more networks

```
Run 'docker network COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.

The command output shows how to use the command as well as all of the docker network sub-commands. As you can see from the output, the docker network command allows you to create new networks, list existing networks, inspect networks, and remove networks. It also allows you to connect and disconnect containers from networks.

Step 2: List networks

Run a docker network ls command to view existing container networks on the current Docker host.

```
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
1befe23acd58        bridge              bridge              local
726ead8f4e6b        host                host                local
ef4896538cc7        none                null                local

```
The output above shows the container networks that are created as part of a standard installation of Docker.

New networks that you create will also show up in the output of the docker network ls command.

You can see that each network gets a unique ID and NAME. Each network is also associated with a single driver. Notice that the "bridge" network and the "host" network have the same name as their respective drivers.

Step 3: Inspect a network

The docker network inspect command is used to view network configuration details. These details include; name, ID, driver, IPAM driver, subnet info, connected containers, and more.

Use docker network inspect to view configuration details of the container networks on your Docker host. The command below shows the details of the network called bridge.

```
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "1befe23acd58cbda7290c45f6d1f5c37a3b43de645d48de6c1ffebd985c8af4b",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1500"
        },
        "Labels": {}
    }
]

```
NOTE: The syntax of the docker network inspect command is 
```
docker network inspect <network>

```
where <network> can be either network name or network ID. In the example above we are showing the configuration details for the network called "bridge". Do not confuse this with the "bridge" driver.

Step 4: List network driver plugins

The docker info command shows a lot of interesting information about a Docker installation.

Run a docker info command on any of your Docker hosts and locate the list of network plugins.

```
$ docker info
Containers: 0
 Running: 0
 Paused: 0
 Stopped: 0
Images: 0
Server Version: 1.12.3
Storage Driver: aufs
<Snip>
Plugins:
 Volume: local
 Network: bridge host null overlay    <<<<<<<<
Swarm: inactive
Runtimes: runc
<Snip>

```
