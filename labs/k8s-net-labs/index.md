### Install Kubernetes on AWS
Log into all servers

### MacOS
Run the following commands in a terminal

```
chmod 600 /path/to/k8slab
ssh -i /path/to/k8slab ubuntu@<server IP>

```

### Windows
Open Putty and configure a new session.Expand â€œConnectionSSHAuth and then specify the PPK file
Now save your session

### Install Kubernetes on all servers
Following commands must be run as the root user. To become root run:

```
sudo su -

```

Install packages required for Kubernetes on all servers as the root user

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -

```

Create Kubernetes repository by running the following as one command.

```
cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF

```
Now that you've added the repository install the packages

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y kubelet=1.11.3-00 kubeadm=1.11.3-00 kubectl

```
The kubelet is now restarting every few seconds, as it waits in a crashloop for kubeadm to tell it what to do.

### Initialize the Master
Run the following command on the master node to initialize

```
kubeadm init --kubernetes-version=1.11.3

```
If everything was successful output will contain

Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

Note the kubeadm join... command, it will be needed later on.

Exit to ubuntu user

```
exit

```
Now configure server so you can interact with Kubernetes as the unprivileged user.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```
Run following on the master to enable IP forwarding to IPTables.

```
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

```

### Pod overlay network
Install a Pod network on the master node

```
export kubever=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$kubever"

```
Wait until coredns pod is in a running state

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

```
### Join nodes to cluster
Log into each of the worker nodes and run the join command from kubeadm init master
output.

```
sudo kubeadm join --token <token> <IP>:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash>
```
To confirm nodes have joined successfully log back into master and run

```
watch kubectl get nodes

```
When they are in a Ready state the cluster is online and nodes have been joined.
Congrats!
